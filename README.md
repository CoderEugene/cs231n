# CS231n
*The implementation is not completely based on CS231n assignment, In particular, I reconstruct the code according to my own ideas.*

 - **The dataset we used is [Cifar10 dataset python version](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).**
 - **All the code based on python3.5, and be sure you have install numpy, matplotlib.**
 - **You can also find my thought in my [blog](http://zzcoder.cn/).**
